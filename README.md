# CFNT5B-CP-Analysis
Implementation of CFNT5B-CP framework for testing Hilbert-PÃ³lya conjecture via spectral analysis. Achieves sub-2% eigenvalue-zeta zero correspondence through novel two-stage operator construction. Includes complete Jupyter notebook, eigenvalue datasets (5K-25K scales), zeta zeros, and comprehensive analysis suite. Paper forthcoming July 2025.
