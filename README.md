# CFNT5B-CP: Conservative Framework for Non-Trivial 5-Band Composite Perturbation

## Repository Under Construction

This repository will contain the implementation and data supporting our research on eigenvalue-zeta zero correspondence using the Hilbert-P√≥lya operator framework.

### Planned Release: July 2025

Upon publication, this repository will include:

#### üìÅ Code
- `CFNT5B_Complete_Analysis.ipynb` - Full computational framework
- 14 analysis cells including:
  - Matrix construction demonstrations
  - Conservative hybrid analysis
  - Statistical validation suite
  - Visualization generation

#### üìä Data
- Riemann zeta zeros (10M available, 30,000 required for experiments)
- Unperturbed eigenvalues (5K, 10K, 15K, 20K, 25K)
- Perturbed eigenvalues (5K, 10K, 15K, 20K, 25K)
  - Each with documented perturbation strengths
  - Pre-computed to avoid 6+ hour generation time
- All generated figures

#### üìö Documentation
- Complete usage instructions
- Theoretical background
- Reproducibility guide
